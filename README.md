# Cat Door Manager
An application to manage my parents' automatic cat door. This repository is public so my father can keep track of my progress on the code. Hi Dad :)

## Learning Outcomes
This project will hopefully teach me a number of valuable skills across the stack: Next JS, Tailwind CSS, Flask, and Raspberry Pi/Hardware programming. A stretch goal would be to develop a way to package and push this software remotely, to update the cat door live, using GitHub actions.

## Current State
